# Blue Archive ribbons
This mod replaces normal game ribbons to ribbons featuring characters from the game Blue Archive

Original character artwork made by [寝癖](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/29802308)

## Installation guide
1. Download the latest release "ribbons.zip"
2. Extract the zip file. A new file called "ribbons" should be created containing the mod contents
3. Move the "ribbons" folder to "gui" folder in your game mod folder, usually C:/Games/World_of_Warships/bin/<largest_number>/res_mods/gui
    - If you do not have "gui" folder inside res_mods you need to create one manually there

You are done now. Have fun
